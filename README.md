# Run a laravel
Happy coding in Laravel. 

The problems I had met when I was learning php from the [Offical API Website](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4).

1. DB-Config:  .env in Laravel 5.4

    I google for [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20723803/pdoexception-sqlstatehy000-2002-no-such-file-or-directory) on StackOverFlow. For more information please check the 2nd answer for the question.
    
2. Markdown syntax:  README.md

The README.md is ok from my local machine, but it was not as good as I had expected on the Github page.
